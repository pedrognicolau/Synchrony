# Scripts for Seasonality, density dependence and spatial population synchrony
 
This project corresponds to the scripts and data files used for the manuscript "Seasonality, density dependence and spatial population synchrony" by Pedro G. Nicolau, Rolf A. Ims, Sigrunn H. SÃ¸rbye & Nigel G. Yoccoz

The folder structure is as follows.

Data: important files used to reproduce the code. 

Scripts: scripts necessary for analysis, numbered by order of sequence (some with subnumbering). 0 contains the important functions to compute Bayesian R^2 and correlograms; 01 contains processing for 1; 03 contains processing for 3.

Plots: diverse plots used (or not) in the manuscript; not needed for analysis
